\section{OWASP - Top 10}

The \gls{owasp} is a worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software. One of their main projects is the \gls{owasp} Top 10 list, where a document which represents a broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are is published every 3 years. \\
\\
This project paper is based on the \gls{owasp} Top 10 list of 2013, which was the most current one, when the project started. In Figure \ref{fig:owasp_top_ten_1} there is the list of the respective flaws.
